# Scripts

We provide the original evaluation scripts as used in the LCP 2021 (```lcp_evaluate.py```) and TSAR 2022 shared tasks (```lcp_evaluate.py```).

We additionally provide the exact python notebooks used to produce the results for the MLSP 2024 shared task (```*.ipynb```).

*Note that the flag: ```flagUseComplexWordsInGoldAnnotations``` is set to ```true``` in our evaluation of lexical simplification and is necessary to produce our results.
